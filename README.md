# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the branch of computer science that applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
its imporatance; software engiineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
milestones include the development of programming languages, the establishment of software development as a discpline, the advent of structured programming, and the rise of agile methodologies.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
they are; requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Requirements; is the gathering and documneting user needs and system requirements.

design, is creating detailed and high level designs
Implementation, is writing and building the software according to design specifications.
Testing, conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards
Deployment, is releasing the software to users
Maintainance is providing suppoert, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall, it uses sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downward like a waterfall, while agile its approach iterative and incremental focusing on felxibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer; is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer; ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager; designs the overrall structure and architecture of software systems.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs; are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples visual studio, eclipse
VCS; are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.Examples JUnit, selenium. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements; having a well understood requirement that needs no changes.
Tight deadline; time managing well

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing; is testing individual components or modules of software
integration testing; is testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
system testing; is testing the entire software system as a whole.
acceptance testing; is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from AI assistanr or robot.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Give me a guide to write a resume.
Give me a guide on how to write a resume of a school accountant.
